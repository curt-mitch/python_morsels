"""
It's sometimes hard to know when you should make a class and when you should
just make a couple of functions. This week we're going to make a class and some
functions (in bonus 3) which serve the same purpose.

I'd like you to make a class called NextDate which will help figure out the
date and number of days until the next given weekday.

I'd actually like you to make two classes: NextDate and Weekday. The Weekday
class will have attributes that represent each weekday.

So if it's Friday December 31, 1999 and we want to figure out when next
Thursday is, we could do this:

>>> from datetime import date
>>> from nextdate import NextDate, Weekday
>>> date.today()
datetime.date(1999, 12, 31)
>>> next_thursday = NextDate(Weekday.THURSDAY)
>>> next_thursday.days_until()
6
>>> next_thursday.date()
datetime.date(2000, 1, 6)

When the current date changes, these methods should update their values as
well. For example on Saturday January 1, 2000, it should only be 5 days until
next Thursday:

>>> date.today()
datetime.date(2000, 1, 1)
>>> next_thursday.days_until()
5

If the current date matches the given weekday, the date returned should be
today and days_until should return 0.

    def days_until(self):
        return (self.date() - date.today()).days

    def date(self):
        today = date.today()
        return today + timedelta((self.future_day - today.weekday()) % 7)


class Weekday:
    MONDAY = 0
    TUESDAY = 1
    WEDNESDAY = 2
    THURSDAY = 3
    FRIDAY = 4
    SATURDAY = 5
    SUNDAY = 6
